# Chatbot-using-nltk-and-keras

This project is a chatbot that is trained on a dataset of intents. The intents are represented as a bag-of-words, and the model is a 3-layer neural network with a softmax output layer.

# Requirements
**1. Python 3.8+**

**2. Keras**

**3. NLTK**

**4. Pickle**

# Instructions
**1. Clone the repository.**

**2. Install the requirements.**

**3. Run the train.py script to train the model.**

**4.Run the chatbot.py script to start the chatbot.**

# Usage
The chatbot can be used to interact with the user in natural language. For example, the user can say "What is your name?" and the chatbot will respond with "My name is Bard."

# Dataset
The dataset for this project is a collection of intents that are represented as a bag-of-words. The dataset can be found in the data/intents.json file.

# Model
The model for this project is a 3-layer neural network with a softmax output layer. The model is trained on the dataset of intents, and it can be used to predict the intent of a given sentence.

# To-Do
**1. Add more intents to the dataset.**


**2. Improve the accuracy of the model.**


**3. Add more features to the chatbot.**


**I hope this helps!**
